# TODO list

## Priority
* Collect sufficient information about cookies, store it properly
* `webRequest` code is funky

## Later
* Make `webRequest` optional.

## Fixed?
* Options UI can be too tall (long vertically) for the provided pace. In that case, window can't resolve th right heght and scroll thing and just starts shaking. Fixed by setting body{height:700px}.
