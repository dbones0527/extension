    <p>The following settings enable additional functionality of this extension, but require additional permissions.</p>
	
    <ul>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" id="DevTools">
        <label for="DevTools">Developer Tools pane</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="checkbox" id="WebRequest">
        <label for="WebRequest">Track network requests</label>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Developer tools pane is located in "Menu">"More tools">"Developer tools". This pane is more convenient then just the popup interface, since it does not close when user interacts with the page. This feature requires devtools permission, which can not be dynamically requested.</p>
    <p>Extension can track network requests to detect when cookies are set via Set-Cookie header in the HTTP(S) response and record whether the connection was secure or not. This requires WebRequest permission, which is dynamically requested every time you enable this feature (browser might prompt you for this permission only the first time you enable it).</p>
